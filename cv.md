Summary
---

My goal is to learn how to translate thoughts into code and learn how to create websites and programs that will solve users problems. I have no programming experience but I study every day. I have a high level of discipline. I set goals for the sprint (3 or 9 weeks), make a plan, and gradually move in the right direction.
